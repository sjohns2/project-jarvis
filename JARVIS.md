# JARVIS - Just A Rather Very Intelligent System

**Your Personal AI Assistant for Development Work**

JARVIS is built on top of [Archon](README.md) and provides a natural language voice interface for coordinating specialist AI agents, managing your knowledge base, and assisting with development tasks.

Inspired by Tony Stark's AI assistant from the MCU, JARVIS brings intelligent orchestration and voice control to your development workflow.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

All the same as [Archon](README.md), plus:
- OpenAI API key (for Whisper & TTS)
- Anthropic API key (for JARVIS intelligence)
- Microphone access (for voice input)

### Setup

1. **Ensure Archon is configured**:
   ```bash
   # Make sure you have .env configured with:
   # - SUPABASE_URL
   # - SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
   # - OPENAI_API_KEY
   # - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Add JARVIS configuration to .env**:
   ```bash
   # JARVIS Configuration
   JARVIS_PORT=8055
   JARVIS_VOICE_PORT=3738
   JARVIS_USER_NAME=BMad  # Or your preferred name

   # Cost Optimization (Phase 1.5)
   JARVIS_DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
   JARVIS_ADVANCED_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
   JARVIS_COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD=0.8
   JARVIS_ENABLE_CACHE=true
   ```

3. **Start all services** (including JARVIS):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access JARVIS**:
   - **Voice Interface**: http://localhost:3738
   - **Archon Dashboard**: http://localhost:3737 (for management)

---

## 💬 Using JARVIS

### Voice Interface

1. Open http://localhost:3738
2. Click and hold the JARVIS circle
3. Speak your command
4. Release to process
5. Listen to JARVIS's response

### Example Commands

```
"JARVIS, what's the status of my tasks?"
→ Queries Archon knowledge base for task information

"JARVIS, design an authentication system for my Next.js app"
→ Deploys Vilya (System Architect) to analyze and recommend

"JARVIS, analyze the requirements for a real-time chat feature"
→ Deploys Nenya (Product Manager) for requirements analysis

"JARVIS, research authentication best practices"
→ Deploys Narya (Research Analyst) + queries knowledge base

"JARVIS, good morning"
→ Greets you and reports system status
```

### How Phase 2.0 Works (Real Agent Spawning)

When you ask JARVIS to do something complex:

1. **Intent Interpretation** (Haiku 4.5)
   - JARVIS analyzes your command
   - Determines which specialist agent(s) to deploy
   - Assesses task complexity

2. **Knowledge Gathering**
   - Queries Archon knowledge base for relevant context
   - Extracts top 3 most relevant documents
   - Prepares context for the agent

3. **Agent Forging** (Sonnet 4.5)
   - Loads specialist prompt from `bmad-integration/agents/`
   - Combines: Agent expertise + Your task + Knowledge context
   - Spawns Claude agent with 4000 token budget

4. **Parallel Execution** (if multiple agents)
   - Uses `asyncio.gather()` for simultaneous execution
   - All agents work in parallel for speed
   - Example: Nenya, Vilya, and Narya all analyze together

5. **Response Delivery**
   - JARVIS presents the agent's detailed analysis
   - Voice synthesis speaks the response
   - Full details logged for reference

**Example Flow:**
```
You: "JARVIS, design an auth system for my Next.js app"

→ JARVIS selects Vilya (System Architect)
→ Queries knowledge base for "Next.js authentication"
→ Loads Vilya's 7,000 char expert prompt
→ Vilya analyzes:
   • Reviews Next.js 15 architecture
   • Evaluates NextAuth vs Clerk vs Supabase
   • Designs database schema
   • Plans API routes
   • Considers security
   • Provides implementation steps

→ Returns 2,000+ char detailed architecture plan
→ JARVIS speaks the summary via voice
```

## 🎭 JARVIS Personality

JARVIS communicates with a professional, respectful tone inspired by the MCU character:

- **Addresses you appropriately** (default: "Sir", customizable via JARVIS_USER_NAME)
- **Acknowledges commands** ("Understood, Sir.")
- **Reports progress** ("Engaging Vilya, Sir.")
- **Provides status updates** ("Analysis complete.")
- **Handles errors gracefully** ("I'm afraid I've encountered a difficulty, Sir.")

---

## 🤖 Specialist Agents (Rings)

JARVIS can deploy specialist agents from the BMAD ecosystem:

### Phase 1 Rings (Available Now)

1. **Nenya** - Product Manager
   - Requirements analysis
   - Stakeholder mapping
   - User stories

2. **Vilya** - System Architect
   - Architecture design
   - Tech stack decisions
   - System patterns

3. **Narya** - Research Analyst
   - Competitive analysis
   - Feasibility studies
   - Research

### Phase 2 (Coming Soon)

- Full Project ORTRTA integration (7 Rings)
- Custom BMAD agents (40+ more)
- Dynamic agent loading

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### JARVIS Status

```bash
# Check JARVIS health
curl http://localhost:8055/health

# View loaded rings
curl http://localhost:8055/api/rings

# View conversation history
curl http://localhost:8055/api/conversation-history
```

### View Logs

```bash
# JARVIS brain logs
docker compose logs jarvis-brain -f

# Voice interface logs
docker compose logs jarvis-voice -f
```

### Cost Statistics (Phase 1.5)

Monitor your API usage and costs:

```bash
# Get cost and usage statistics
curl http://localhost:8055/api/cost-stats
```

Response includes:
- Total API calls (Haiku vs Sonnet)
- Cache hit rate
- Estimated cost in USD
- Model usage percentage

---

## 💰 Cost Optimization (Phase 1.5)

JARVIS Phase 1.5 introduces smart cost optimization to keep API costs minimal while maintaining high performance.

### How It Works

**Smart Model Selection**:
- **Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) - Fast and cheap for 90% of tasks
  - Input: $1 per million tokens
  - Output: $5 per million tokens
  - Perfect for: greetings, status checks, intent classification

- **Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`) - Powerful for complex tasks
  - Input: $3 per million tokens
  - Output: $15 per million tokens
  - Used for: multi-agent coordination, technical analysis

**Intelligent Complexity Detection**:
JARVIS automatically analyzes each command and determines complexity:
- Simple (0.0-0.3): Greetings, basic queries → Uses Haiku
- Moderate (0.4-0.7): Information requests → Uses Haiku
- Complex (0.8-1.0): Agent coordination, architecture → Uses Sonnet (if threshold ≥ 0.8)

**Response Caching**:
- Caches responses for 1 hour
- Reduces redundant API calls
- Perfect for repeated queries

### Configuration

```bash
# Default model for most tasks (cheap, fast)
JARVIS_DEFAULT_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001

# Advanced model for complex tasks (expensive, powerful)
JARVIS_ADVANCED_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

# Complexity threshold (0.0-1.0)
# Higher = use Sonnet more often (more expensive)
# Lower = use Haiku more often (cheaper)
JARVIS_COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD=0.8  # Recommended

# Enable response caching
JARVIS_ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

### Estimated Costs

Based on typical usage patterns (avg. 300 input tokens, 150 output tokens per command):

**Light Use** (10 commands/day):
- ~95% Haiku, ~5% Sonnet
- Haiku: 9.5 calls/day × $0.00105 = $0.30/month
- Sonnet: 0.5 calls/day × $0.00315 = $0.05/month
- **Total: ~$0.35/month**

**Moderate Use** (50 commands/day):
- ~90% Haiku, ~10% Sonnet
- Haiku: 45 calls/day × $0.00105 = $1.42/month
- Sonnet: 5 calls/day × $0.00315 = $0.47/month
- **Total: ~$1.89/month**

**Heavy Use** (200 commands/day):
- ~90% Haiku, ~10% Sonnet
- Haiku: 180 calls/day × $0.00105 = $5.67/month
- Sonnet: 20 calls/day × $0.00315 = $1.89/month
- **Total: ~$7.56/month**

**With Caching** (30% cache hit rate):
- Reduces costs by ~30%
- Heavy use: **~$5.29/month**

### Cost Monitoring

Check your costs in real-time:

```bash
# Via API
curl http://localhost:8055/api/cost-stats

# Via JARVIS voice command
"JARVIS, what's your status?"
# Returns API usage and estimated costs
```

### Tips for Minimizing Costs

1. **Keep cache enabled** - Reduces redundant API calls
2. **Use higher complexity threshold** (0.8-0.9) - Uses Haiku more often
3. **Batch similar queries** - Take advantage of caching
4. **Monitor usage** - Check `/api/cost-stats` regularly
